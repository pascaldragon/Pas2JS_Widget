# Web Component Library
Web Component Library (formerly Pas2JS Widgetset) is a RAD Framework to develop Web Applications like to develop Windows Applications originally started by HÃ©lio S. Ribeiro and Anderson J. Gado da Silva and further improved by Sven Barth.

### Thanks
This project is only possible thanks to [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/ "Free Pascal"), [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/ "Lazarus") and the fabulous compiler [Pas2JS](http://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js "Pas2JS")

### Requirements
* Lazarus 2.0.10 or newer
* _pas2js_ 2.0 or newer

### Help Please
This project is under development.
This version is an basic implementation and many bugs need to be corrected.
Please help us to take this project forward.

### Install
This was tested with Lazarus 2.0.10 and Lazarus 2.1 using version 2.0 of _pas2js_.
* make sure that the _pas2jsdsgn_ package is installed
* the _pas2js_rtl_ package should have been opened (so that the IDE knows about it)
* install the _wcldsgn_ package from _design/package_
* open the _wcl_ package in _widgets_ (again so that the IDE knows about it)

### Usage
* create a new _Web Browser Application_ (this is provided by the Pas2JS package; the _Application (Pas2JS)_ template is currently not useable)
* add the following packages as dependencies:
  - _pas2js_rtl_
  - _WCL_
* add _-JRjs_ to the custom compiler options
* change the code of the main project to the following:

      program YourProject;

      {$mode objfpc}

      uses
        Forms, Interfaces;

      begin
        Application.Initialize;
        Application.Run;
      end.

* add forms and frames by using the _Web Form (Pas2JS)_ and _Web Frame (Pas2JS)_ templates respectively (data module is not yet tested)
* once you saved your project you also need to adjust the name of the script in the HTML file's `script` tag

### Notes
* you need to manually add the `Application.CreateForm(TFormClass, FormVariable);` statement for now (`TFormClass` is the class of _your_ form and `FormVariable` is the variable declared in your form's unit)
* you can only use components from the _WCL_ tab

### Further plans
* fix project template
* test data module template
* implement support for DB controls
* implement a Lazarus compatible grid
* better maintenance of the project's HTML file
* better maintenance of the project's main program file
* more dynamic layouting of the components
